# Robust ML for CPS

Repository for the paper "Robustness and Generalization Performance of Deep Learning Models on
Cyber-Physical Systems: A Comparative Study" by Alexander WIndmann, Henrik Steude and Oliver Niggemann.

## Get started
### Install the dependencies
From the root of this repo, run:
```sh
poetry install
```

### Generate the data
The data is generated by running '1-generate-data.ipynb' in the notebooks folder. The notebook will also provide visualizations to analyze the datasets.


### Run the model training
From the root of this repo, do:
```sh
unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
poetry run python run_training.py
```

### Run the model fine-tuning
From the root of this repo, do:
```sh
unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
poetry run python run_finetuning.py  --LOG_DIR logs/<your-path>
```
